# LINEAR SEARCH

## Description
The list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked

A simple approach is to do a linear search, i.e  

Start from the leftmost element of arr[] and one by one compare x with each element of arr[]
 - If x matches with an element, return the index.
 - If x doesnâ€™t match with any of elements, return -1.
